# CDKTF Project

This repository contains a CDKTF (Cloud Development Kit for Terraform) implementation to manage infrastructure on AWS. CDKTF allows you to define your infrastructure using familiar programming languages, making it easier to manage and maintain your cloud resources.

## Overview

This project uses CDKTF to define infrastructure resources, such as:

- [List of resources like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, EKS clusters, etc.]
- [Any additional infrastructure components]

CDKTF provides a modern, object-oriented approach to managing cloud resources, allowing you to use familiar programming languages like TypeScript, Python, Java, or C# to define infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using this repository, you need to have the following installed:

1. **Node.js**: CDKTF is built on Node.js. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Terraform**: Terraform is required to apply the configurations. Download it from [terraform.io](https://www.terraform.io/downloads).

3. **CDKTF CLI**: You can install the CDKTF CLI globally using npm:
